# Design Pattern in Python

Design Patterns are reusable and customizable solutions to recurring problems in software development.
Overall, a design pattern is made up of four elements:

- **Pattern name**: the reference used to describe a design problem, its solutions and its consequences;
- **Problem**: the context in which design pattern is applicable;
- **Solution**: the elementary composition of the design pattern, its relationships, its responsibilities etc.
- **Consequences**: the advantages and disadvantages of applying the design pattern.

Nowadays, there are 23 design patterns distributed categorically in:

- **Creative Patterns**  
Creation Design Patterns abstract the creative process. They help make a system independent of how its objects are created, composed and represented.
- **Structural Patterns**  
 Structural Design Patterns are concerned with way both classes and objects are composed to build larger structures.
- **Behavioral Patterns**  
Bahavioral Design Patterns are concerned with algorithms and assignment of responsibilities between objects. Behavioral patterns don't only describe of objects or classes, but also the patterns of communication between them.
